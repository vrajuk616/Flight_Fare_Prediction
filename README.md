# Flight_Fare_Prediction
End-to-End project on Flight Price Prediction âœˆ ðŸ’° âœ… with 7 Regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Ada Boost Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Light GBM Regressor)

Light GBM Regressor gave the best score with 0.937 âœ…. However, the limitation of the project is the data, which has considered limited parameters that help us estimate the fare, and this project assumes that all the other parameters that contribute to the change in fare from time to time remain constant.

Future work: The future work will be on improving the code reusability and using all the other possible models and producing even better accuracy if possible.
